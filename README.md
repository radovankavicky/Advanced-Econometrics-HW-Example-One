Advanced-Econometrics-HW-Example-One
====================================

This repository contains all the supporting files related to an assignment I completed for a graduate level course in advanced econometrics.  The assignment is the work of the course instructor and TA.  All materials have been scrubbed of course identifying information.  Some of the supplemental MATLAB function files were originally written by the course TA, whose name has been replaced with Anonymous in those files.  All other work is my own.  The following files are included:

1. HW-2-Part-1.pdf details the first part of the assignment.
2. HW-2-Part-2.pdf details the second part of the assignment.
3. Advanced-Econometrics-HW2.pdf is the main written HW submission file.
4. HW2Q1.m is the main MATLAB script file that produces the results for the first part of the assignment.
5. NLSobj.m is a MATLAB supporting function file, originally written by the TA and updated by me. 
6. HW2Q2.m is the main MATLAB script file that produces the results for the second part of the assignment.
7. GMMoptW.m is a MATLAB supporting function file, originally written by the TA and updated by me. 
8. GMMcovmat.m is a MATLAB supporting function file, originally written by the TA and updated by me.
